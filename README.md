# Hi, I'm Tim

## Why read me?

I'm writing this in the hope that we can fast forward through some getting-to-know-you facets of me that we might miss (of course doing so IRL is better, but not always possible).

I am really keen to do great work with/for you and I can be extremely, extraordinarily creative and productive under the right conditions.

I am also very imperfect and I hope that my transparency about them here is not treated as an excuse for my flaws but as a guide for you to know how I might fail. Consider this an open invite for you to call me out and prevent bigger pain down the road.
 
## Me in a few words

- I'm Hatim from Tangier, Morocco. I enjoy creating software, games, mobile apps and websites for both myself, and for clients.C, C#,
Javascript, PHP, Python, Java.
